## Overview
**AWS Resource Audit** is a shell script that automates the process of listing various AWS resources across multiple services in a specified region. This tool is ideal for auditing and keeping track of resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, and more.

## Features
- Lists resources from multiple AWS services:
  - EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, VPC, IAM, Route53, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, Lambda, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, EBS
- Supports dynamic service listing for easy extensibility
- Allows listing resources for a specific service or all services at once
- Provides readable JSON output with optional `jq` formatting
- Simple to use with minimal dependencies

## Prerequisites
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured with the necessary permissions.
- **jq** (optional) for pretty-printing JSON output.
- AWS credentials configured (use `aws configure` to set up access keys and default region).

## Usage
```
./GET_aws_resource_audit.sh <aws_region> <aws_service|all>
```

## Arguments
- <aws_region>: AWS region code (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1).
- <aws_service>: (Optional) AWS service to list resources for. Use all to list resources for all supported services.

## Examples
List EC2 Instances in us-east-1:
```bash
  ./GET_aws_resource_audit.sh us-east-1 ec2
```
List all resources in us-west-2:
```bash
  ./GET_aws_resource_audit.sh us-west-2 all
```
## Supported Services
The script supports the following AWS services:
-   Compute: EC2, Lambda
-   Storage: S3, EBS
-   Database: RDS, DynamoDB
-   Networking: VPC, Route53, CloudFront
-   Security: IAM
-   Messaging: SNS, SQS
-   Monitoring: CloudWatch
-   Infrastructure Management: CloudFormation

For a complete list of supported services and usage instructions, run:
```bash
./GET_aws_resource_audit.sh --help
```
## Output

The script outputs JSON-formatted data for each service, making it easy to analyze or save to a file.

Example Output for EC2 Instances:
```bash
{
  "Reservations": [
    {
      "Instances": [
        {
          "InstanceId": "i-0123456789abcdef0",
          "InstanceType": "t2.micro",
          "State": {
            "Name": "running"
          },
          "PublicIpAddress": "54.123.45.67",
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting
- AWS CLI Not Installed: Make sure the AWS CLI is installed and accessible in your PATH.
- AWS CLI Not Configured: Run aws configure to set up your AWS credentials.
- Invalid Service: Check the list of supported services in this README or by using the --help flag.
